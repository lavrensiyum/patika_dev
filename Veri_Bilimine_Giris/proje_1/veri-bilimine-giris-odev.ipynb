    "In chemistry, the importance of data science is in the collection and processing of data from experiments or instrumental analysis. If we add the concept of \"Machine Learning\" in the middle of these two disciplines, in addition to the collection and processing of data, capabilities such as prediction, better understanding and interpretation of data are unlocked. Ultimately, machine learning is nothing without data, and data is nothing without processing. Therefore, it is necessary to combine these two topics. \n"
